            Four years ago, the founder of Selfish Darling lost her wellbeing
            and ultimately herself. She bounced from one doctor to the next,
            desperate for them to take her problems seriously.

          <p id="second-paragraph">
            No one she spoke to could see the link between her mental wellbeing
            and the symptoms her body was presenting and resorted to throwing
            anti-depressants at the problem or recommended that she leave London
            as surely this was the 'real' cause of her stress.

            After many years of research, appointments and travelling to see
            specialists abroad, she finally was diagnosed with an underactive
            thyroid, hormonal imbalance and vitamin deficiencies. All of these
            things could have been picked up in those early GP consultations if
            only they had listened, done the right blood tests and connected the
            dots.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout this journey to better her own health, the massive gap
            between the information, the access and the everyday patient became
            clear. She found a significant need for female health-focused
            solutions where women are not solely reliant on the limited options
            and treatment their GP has to offer. It also brought to light how
            much pressure women are facing daily - it isn't just the social
            pressures, but our changing bodies and how that affects our
            fertility, hormones, mental health and yet so many of these topics
            we just don't' talk about.

            Selfish Darling is the answer to that need. We aim to empower women
            to have all that they envision for their lives without their health
            holding them back. So we've set out to build the first comprehensive
            women's health digital service.

            Giving women access to a platform putting them in front of
            specialists in gynaecological health, educational articles and
            seminars and connecting them with like-minded women through in-app
            support groups.

            We're not stopping there - we know that a big reason why women
            struggle for years to get their diagnosis, treatment or cure is down
            to the big data gap in female health. To change this, we will be
            dedicating part of the revenue from every in-app appointment to fund
            gynaecological research. We aim to change the game for women's
            health care for generations to come!
